# degenerate-dots-implementation
This repository contains a python notebook which implements the optimization in the paper.
First we define functions corresponding to the presented equations (appropiately commented and referenced)
Then we show to examples of bit erasure:
1. Fixing the boundary conditions on E(τ) (not presented in the paper)
2. Fixing the boundary conditions on p(τ) (presented in the paper)
