# degenerate-dots-implementation
This repository contains a python notebook which implements the optimization in the paper.
First we define functions corresponding to the presented equations (appropiately commented and referenced)
Then we show to examples of bit erasure:
1. Fixing the boundary conditions on E(τ) (not presented in the paper)
2. Fixing the boundary conditions on p(τ) (presented in the paper)

Feel free to send me an email to ask questions, if you use this code please appropiately cite the paper and this repository [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1028310410.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16567786)
